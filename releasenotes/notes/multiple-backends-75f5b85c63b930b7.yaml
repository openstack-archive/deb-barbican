    Now within a single deployment, multiple secret store plugin backends can
    be configured and used. With this change, a project adminstrator can
    pre-define a preferred plugin backend for storing their secrets. New APIs
    are added to manage this project level secret store preference.
features:
  - New feature to support multiple secret store plugin backends. This feature
    is not enabled by default. To use this feature, the relevant feature flag
    needs to be enabled and supporting configuration needs to be added in the
    service configuration. Once enabled, a project adminstrator will be able
    to specify one of the available secret store backends as a preferred
    secret store for their project secrets. This secret store preference
    applies only to new secrets (key material) created or stored within that
    project. Existing secrets are not impacted. See http://docs.openstack.org/developer/barbican/setup/plugin_backends.html
    for instructions on how to setup Barbican multiple backends, and the API
    documentation for further details.
