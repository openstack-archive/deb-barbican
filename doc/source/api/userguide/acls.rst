******************
ACL API User Guide
******************

By default Barbican manages access to its resources (secrets, containers) on a per project
level, whereby a user is allowed access to project resources based on the roles a user has
in that project.

Some Barbican use cases prefer a more fine-grained access control for secrets and containers,
such as at the user level. The Access Control List (ACL) feature supports this more restrictive
access.

This guide will assume you will be using a local running development environment of Barbican.
If you need assistance with getting set up, please reference the :doc:`development guide </setup/dev>`.

.. warning::

    This ACL documentation is work in progress and may change in near future.


ACL Definition
##############

ACL defines a set of attributes which are used in policy-based authorization to determine
access to a target resource. ACL definition is operation specific and is defined per
secret or per container.

Currently only the 'read' operation is defined. This supports allowing users on the ACL for a
secret to retrieve its metadata or to decrypt its payload. This also allows users on the ACL
for a container to retrieve its list of secret references.

ACL allow a secret or a container to be marked private. Private secret/container means that only
the user who created the secret/container can extract secret. Users with necessary roles on a
secret/container project will not have access. To allow access to other users, their user ids
need to be added in related ACL users list.

An operation specific ACL definition has following attribute:
  * `users`: Whitelist of users who are allowed access to target resource. In this case a user means
    a Keystone user id.
  * `project-access`: Flag to mark a secret or a container private for an operation. Pass `false` to
    mark private.

To acommplish above mentioned behavior for a secret/container resource, having ACL data populated
alone is not sufficient.

Following ACL rules are defined and used as `OR` in resource access policy:
  * ACL based access is allowed when token user is present in secret/container operation specific
    ACL user list e.g. token user present in `read` users list.
  * When secret/container resource is marked private, then project-level RBAC users access is not
    allowed.

.. note::

    Currently Barbican default policy just makes use of `read` ACL data only. So only **GET**
    calls for a secret and a container resource will make use of ACL data. Other request methods on
    secret and container resource still uses project level RBAC checks in policy.

As per default policy rules, a user with `admin` role in a secret/container project or a user who
has created the secret/container can manage ACL for that secret/container.

.. _default_implicit_acl:

Default ACL
-----------

By default when no ACL is explicitly set on a secret or a container, then clients with necessary
roles on secret's project or container's project can access it. This default access pattern translates
to `project-access` as true and no `users` in ACL settings. That's why every secret and container by
default has following implicit ACL.

.. code-block:: json
    
    {
      "read":{
        "project-access": true
      }
    }


Above default ACL is also returned on **GET** on secret/container **acl** resource when no
explicit ACL is set on it.


.. _set_acl:

How to Set/Replace ACL

Container and Secret ACL(s) update operation are similar except `containers` resource is used
instead of the `secrets` resource in URI. To get more details on ACL update APIs, you can reference
the :ref:`Update Secret ACL <put_secret_acl>` , :ref:`Update Container ACL <put_container_acl>`
, :ref:`Partial Update Secret ACL <patch_secret_acl>` or :ref:`Partial Update Container ACL
<patch_container_acl>` documentation.


.. _retrieve_acl:

How to Retrieve ACL
###################

The ACL defined for a secret or container can be retrieved by using a **GET** operation on
respective **acl** resource.
The returned response contains ACL data.

To get secret ACL data:

:ref:`Get Container ACL <get_container_acl>` documentation.


.. _delete_acl:

How to Delete ACL
#################

ACL defined for a secret or a container can be deleted by using the **DELETE** operation on their respective `acl`
resource. There is no response content returned on successful deletion.

Delete operation removes existing ACL on a secret or a container if there. It can be treated as resetting a secret
or a container to :ref:`Default ACL<default_implicit_acl>` setting. That's why invoking delete multiple times on
this resource will not result in error.

.. code-block:: bash

    Request:

    curl -X DELETE -H 'X-Auth-Token:b06183778aa64b17beb6215e60686a60' \
    http://localhost:9311/v1/secrets/50f5ed8e-004e-433a-939c-fa73c7fc81fd/acl

    Response:

    200 OK


To get more details on ACL delete APIs, you can reference the :ref:`Delete Secret ACL <delete_secret_acl>` ,
:ref:`Delete Container ACL <delete_container_acl>` documentation.
