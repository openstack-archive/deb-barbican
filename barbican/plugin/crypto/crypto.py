    """Key Encryption Key Meta DTO

    Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) in Barbican are intended to represent a
    distinct key that is used to perform encryption on secrets for a particular
    project.

    ``KEKMetaDTO`` objects are provided to cryptographic backends by Barbican
    to allow plugins to persist metadata related to the project's KEK.

    For example, a plugin that interfaces with a Hardware Security Module (HSM)
    may want to use a different encryption key for each project. Such a plugin
    could use the ``KEKMetaDTO`` object to save the key ID used for that
    project.  Barbican will persist the KEK metadata and ensure that it is
    provided to the plugin every time a request from that same project is
    processed.

    .. attribute:: plugin_name

        String attribute used by Barbican to identify the plugin that is bound
        to the KEK metadata.  Plugins should not change this attribute.

    .. attribute:: kek_label

        String attribute used to label the project's KEK by the plugin.
        The value of this attribute should be meaningful to the plugin.
        Barbican does not use this value.

    .. attribute:: algorithm

        String attribute used to identify the encryption algorithm used by the
        plugin. e.g. "AES", "3DES", etc.  This value should be meaningful to
        the plugin.  Barbican does not use this value.

    .. attribute:: mode

        String attribute used to identify the algorithm mode used by the
        plugin.  e.g. "CBC", "GCM", etc.  This value should be meaningful to
        the plugin.  Barbican does not use this value.

    .. attribute:: bit_length

        Integer attribute used to identify the bit length of the KEK by the
        plugin.  This value should be meaningful to the plugin.  Barbican does
        not use this value.

    .. attribute:: plugin_meta

       String attribute used to persist any additional metadata that does not
       fit in any other attribute.  The value of this attribute is defined by
       the plugin.  It could be used to store external system references, such
       as Key IDs in an HSM, URIs to an external service, or any other data
       that the plugin deems necessary to persist.  Because this is just a
       plain text field, a plug in may even choose to persist data such as key
       value pairs in a JSON object.
