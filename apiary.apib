Secrets Resource
The following is a description of the resources dealing with generic secrets.
These can be encryption keys or anything else a user wants to store in a secure,
auditable manner

Allows a user to list all secrets in a tenant. Note: the actual secret
should not be listed here, a user must make a separate call to get the
secret details to view the secret.
